# **Visualization of Data Models**

## üìö Overview

This repository provides a collection of **Jupyter notebooks** dedicated to the **visualization of different data models**, including:

- Machine Learning visualizations
- Echelon visualizations
- Custom data structure visualizations

These notebooks are designed to help data scientists, developers, and researchers explore, analyze, and interpret the underlying structure and behavior of models, algorithms, and datasets. Each notebook offers a mix of intuitive visualizations and practical insights into the data flow, structure, and results.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive Jupyter Notebooks**: Hands-on notebooks that let you explore visualizations of various models in real-time.
- **Machine Learning Visualizations**: Understand how your ML models behave, their decision boundaries, feature importances, and performance.
- **Echelon Visualizations**: Dive into echelon graphs that help represent hierarchical data structures and their interconnections.
- **Data Structure Representations**: Visualize relationships between different entities in a dataset, such as database schemas or graph models.

## üîç Notebooks Included

### 1. **Machine Learning Model Visualizations**
- Visualize decision boundaries of classification models (e.g., SVMs, decision trees).
- Interpret feature importance and relationships in regression and classification tasks.
- Explore clustering algorithms visually (K-means, DBSCAN, etc.).

### 2. **Echelon Visualizations**
- Visualize hierarchical structures and nested relationships.
- Understand multi-level data relationships, useful in representing nested data or taxonomies.

### 3. **Data Model Diagrams**
- Visualize data schemas, graph models, and relational models.
- Create visual representations of custom data structures to enhance understanding and debugging.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Required Python libraries (listed below)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/saineshnakra/visualization-of-data-models.git
   cd visualization-of-data-models
   ```


2. Launch Jupyter notebooks:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. Open and run the notebooks from the browser interface.

## üìä How to Use the Notebooks

Each notebook in the repository is designed for a specific type of data visualization. You can open any notebook to:

- **Interact with data**: Load sample datasets or use your own.
- **Visualize**: Run the code cells to generate the visualizations.
- **Modify and experiment**: Play around with parameters to see how the visual outputs change in real-time.
  
For example, in the **Machine Learning Visualization** notebook, you can experiment with different algorithms and observe how their decision boundaries evolve.
